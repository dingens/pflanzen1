\section{Introduction}






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Scope of Application}
\label{sec:usecase}

  In the following section we describe the scope of application for which our
  application was build for. We deduced it from the more general task of
  building a IoT application for planter pots given at the start of the course.

  We assume several separate planter pots are given. These can have some
  distance between each other but are located in one general location.

  The application to build should allow to monitor the humidity of each single
  planter pot separately and remotely, e.g. from a computer indoors. The parts
  of the system responsible for humidity monitoring, i.e. sensor nodes, should
  be easy to install, require low maintenance and so be able to remain with the
  planter pots or inside the soil for long periods of time. As an extra
  prerequisite specific for the course, we were asked to use the Atmel
  \textit{SAM R21 Xplained Pro} MCU (see \cite{samr21}, SAMR21 in the
  following) as hardware for the sensor nodes. Another option was to use the
  Phytec \textit{PhyNode} MCU (see \cite{phywave}), but is was clear from the
  beginning of the course, that they were only available in limited numbers.
  Moreover, these MCUs should run \textit{RIOT} as their operating system.

  Additionally to humidity monitoring, the system should take care of watering
  the planter pots automatically.

\section{Planning}
\subsection{Planned Solution}
  \paragraph{Sensor and pump control nodes} To measure humidity of the single
  planter pots, we decided to use the SAMR21 MCUs as sensor nodes which should
  run the RIOT operating system. These should therefore each be equipped with
  an external humidity sensor to measure soil moisture. We regarded the
  integration of additional sensors as temperature, light or air humidity
  sensors as desirable but not a central part of the project. We also planned
  for the possibility of multi-hop routing between the sensor nodes to increase
  the maximum range in which they can be placed.

  Additionally to monitoring purposes, one central goal described in the
  section \textit{Scope of Application} was to water the planter pots. We
  therefore decided  to introduce an additional node which should collect all
  sensor data and control a water pump. When turned on, the pump should water
  all plants collectively to simplify the setup.

  The decision of using the SAMR21 as sensor nodes and pump controller had a
  big impact on the planned system architecture, as it has a low power
  consumption and offers wireless connectivity via 6LoWPAN over IEEE802.15.4.
  Together, this should increase battery lifetime and reduce the need for
  maintenance, as was one of our set goals.

  \paragraph{Gateway node and web front-end} Another node should receive data
  from the pump control node and publish it to a web server under our control.
  It therefore had to be able to connect to the local network via Ethernet or
  WiFi based on IEEE802.11. A web front-end should then allow to monitor all
  sensor data remotely.

	  \caption{Overview of the general system architecture resulting from
	  the analysis of the given task described in the previous section.}
    \label{fig:schema}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{Milestones}
  We decided to set 3 Milestones for the project as follows:

		the sensor nodes.
	\item Basic web server working on mock sensor data.
	\item Basic pump control algorithm working on mock sensor data.
      \end{itemize}
    \item[M2:]
      \begin{itemize}
	\item Improved integration of sensors.
	\item Improved network stack.
	\item Integration of pump hardware.
	\item Improved pump control algorithm.
	\item Gateway node connecting pump node to web server.
      \end{itemize}
    \item[M3:]

	\item Full integration of sensor nodes, pump control node, gateway and
		web server / web interface.
	\item Watering based on real sensor data.
	\item Multi-hop routing for sensor nodes.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sensors}
\label{sec:sensors}
  The \textit{SEN0114} \cite{SEN} sensor was selected for the central task of collecting
  data on soil moisture. This was decided due to the following reasons:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item There was previous experience with integrating the sensor with the
	    SAMR21 and RIOT (see \cite{watrli}).
    \item The integration via RIOT's ADC interface \cite{riot_adc} seemed
	    simple.
    \item The sensor uses a gold plating which leads good resistance against
	    corrosion and provides longlivety.
  \end{itemize}

  A basic integration of the sensor was achieved during M1. To do so, we
  connected the analog output of the sensor with the SAMR21's GPIO PA06 which
  is one of the default inputs for RIOT's ADC interface. We used GPIO PA13 to
  supply power but only switched it on during measurements to further reduce
  the risk of corroding the sensor. This allowed us to read sensor data,
  although it still was uncalibrated.

  As only few SAMR21 were available for the project and to extend the selection
  of sensors, the PhyNode's air humidity and temperature sensors were also
  integrated with the sensor nodes software.

  During M2, a unified interface for all sensors, including mock sensor data
  for RIOT's 'native' platform was implemented.

  Unexpectedly, it took until the end of M3 to collect sensible and calibrated
  sensor data with the SEN0114. This was due to the limited ADC interface of
  RIOT and it's lacking documentation on how to modify the used reference
  voltage. By default, RIOT's ADC interface uses a reference voltage of 1V.
  Experiments with the sensor showed signals between 0V and 1.6V. We therefore
  hat to set the reference voltage to 2V, which can currently only be achieved
  by modifying the RIOT sources.



  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    % \def\svgwidth{\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.16]{stack-sensor}
	  \caption{Implementation of the sensor node. It shows the sensor
	  integration and the implemented network stack.}
    \label{fig:stack_sensor}
  \end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Network}
The network layout we planned was based on the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The sensor nodes are connected via 802.15.4, they should be able to run
	from a battery or solar cell. Some of them may need to be positioned
	with some distance from the house.
  \item As the pump needs a lot of power anyways, the pump controller node
	cannot run from battery but needs a power adapter connected to a wall
	socket. Water for the plants typically is also best available
	near a house, no matter if it is from a tap or from a tank
	storing rain water from the roofs.
  \item To communicate data to a web server, we need a gateway that translates
	from the IOT 15.4 network to TCP/IP internet.
\end{enumerate}

From (2) it follows that we can require the pump to be near a house. We can use
this to put the gateway required by (3) inside the house, where it has
connection both to a WIFI router and the pump control node. Further, (1)
dictates that we use hop-to-hop communication between the sensor and pump
control nodes, because some of the nodes might be positioned too far away from
the house. As the pump control needs to know the sensor data of all sensors, it
makes sense to send all data to it and have it forward everything to the
gateway. Because of this central role we are calling it the \emph{controller}
node. These considerations lead to the network layout shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:schema}.

As the 802.15.4 network is not directly connected to the internet, we decided
to use a hard-configured unique local network from the fc00::/8\cite address
range{rfc4193}. This also allows automatic hot-plug configuration. In contrast
to link-local addresses (fe80::/10), this allows us to use hardcoded, fixed
addresses for some special nodes, namely the controller and the gateway.

Every node has a 16 bit Node ID. In the case of the controller and the gateway,
those are hardcoded, for the sensor nodes one is generated deterministically
from hardware properties (in fact, we use the least significant 16 bits of the
interface identifier), but can also be assigned at compile time if desired.
Each node's unique local address is deduced from this Node ID.

For the hop-to-hop network, we use a RPL tree, rooted at the controller node.
However it is also possible to explicitly define a node's upstream node, should
this prove more reliable. The upstream node, in turn, forwards the data on the
application level to its own upstream node. This forwarding mode in fact is a
remainder from the early development phase when we had not set up RPL yet, but
we decided to keep it to increase flexibility.



%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{H2O Protocol}
When starting the project, we decided to implement our own simple UDP-based
protocol, dubbed h2o protocol, in order to be able to quickly start the
development of the other components without first evaluating different existing
protocols. We had planned to possibly switch to an existing protocol (for
example, CoAP) later, but in the end, our little protocol turned out flexible
enough so we kept it. For example, adding the \verb`set measurement interval`
message type (see below) and the associated hooks could be done easily in a few
minutes and lines of code. Still, if this was a longer ongoing project, the
extra maintenance overhead caused by maintaining our own protocol would
probably justify a migration.

\subsubsection{Header Format}

The h2o protocol is designed to run on udp. Packages are very small to allow it
to run on 802.15.4 which has a 127 byte payload limit. The package header is as
follows (all offsets and lengths measured in bytes). See the file
\verb`extra/protokoll` for details (such as byte order and failure behavior).

\begin{tabu*}{X[1,l]X[1.2,l]X[4,l]X[10,l]}
\toprule  \rowfont[l]{\bfseries}
Offset & Length & Type & Description \\
\midrule
0 & 1 & \verb`uint8_t` & magic number (\texttt{0xac}) \\
1 & 1 & \verb`uint8_t` & version number (\texttt{0x01}) \\
2 & 1 & \verb`uint8_t` & packet length (including header) \\
3 & 1 & \verb`uint8_t` & message type (see below) \\
4 & 2 & \texttt{nodeid\_t} (\texttt{typedef~uint16\_t}) & node ID of the node the package originates from \\
6 & 2 & \verb`uint16_t` & Packet checksum \\
8 & \dots & \verb`uint8_t[]` & Data (depends on the message type, see below) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabu*}

The node ID field is required to conserve the data's original author after the
packet has been forwarded.

The message type consists of a supertype (most significant four bits) that
defines the type of message and associated behavior (for example, the
controller only forwards \texttt{DATA MESSAGE} packets to the gateway); and a
subtype defining the exact contents.

{\center
\begin{tabu*}{>{\ttfamily}l>{\ttfamily}rll}
\toprule  \rowfont{\bfseries}
\multicolumn2{c}{Type} & Description & Data Field Contents \\
\midrule
0x1? &      & DATA MESSAGE & \\
     & 0x11 & temperature & \verb`int16_t`, degrees celsius \\
     & 0x12 & humidity & \verb`int16_t`, 0 to 100 \\
0x2? &      & DATA REQUEST (reserved) & \\
0x3? &      & CONFIGURATION & \\
     & 0x31 & set measurement interval & \verb`uint32_t`, microseconds \\
0x9? &      & WARN (currently unused) & \\
0xA? &      & INFO (currently unused) & \\
\end{tabu*}}


\subsubsection{Server and Client Implementation}
\textit{\textrightarrow~ See \texttt{lib/network.c} for details.}

Receiving is implemented in a very flexible way. The server runs in the background. It deals with basic packet parsing (for example, version and checksum verification), but does nothing more.

Functionality is implemented via hooks that can be registered dynamically (via
the \texttt{h2op\_\allowbreak add\_\allowbreak receive\_\allowbreak hook} and
\texttt{h2op\_\allowbreak del\_\allowbreak receive\_\allowbreak hook})
functions). This is how we configure different behavior for different node
types, for example, only the controller node needs to pass sensor data to the
pump control module. Each registered hook is run for every received packet, the
hooks then check whether the packet is of the type they are interested in and
acts accordingly. Internal behavior, such as the debugging of incoming packets,
is also implemented as a hook.

To make the implementation more coherent, we also use this interface for
internal communication within a node, for example for communicating the pump
bucket's fill level to the pump controller.


Sending is trivial, it is implemented via the \texttt{h2op\_\allowbreak send}
function that gets passed all the variable header fields and a pointer to the
data. \texttt{h2op\_\allowbreak send} then constructs the packet, calculates
the checksum and sends the packet. Because this is quite quick, it happens
within the caller thread.



%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pump Control}

The Pump Control is the set of algorithms that manage the water pump.
In this subsection we present the functions that are being used and the reason
of the developing of these functions.

First of all we have to present the design of the pump controller, in this case
we have implemented a threshold system which allows the controller to decide
the next action of the pump. As we have two types of sensors (the one that
controls the water level of the pump and the rest) there are two types of
thresholds with different values that are defined after a couple of practical
tests.

Once the design is presented we can start to describe the different functions
that are used in the pump control.

Function: reset\_table( int table[~][~])

This function  fills the bidimensional array of 0 and also set to 0 different variables.

The function is used when the pump changes the state(open or close) or when all
the normal sensors (the ones not in water) had sent data.

Function: print\_table (int table[~][~])

This function prints in the console the ID, the last value received and the
time when the value was received of each sensor stored in the table.
The function is used to control the correct functioning of the table and of the
algorithm and to control that the pump is receiving the correct values of the
different sensors.
It is a purely informative function.

Function: initialize\_pump()

This function is used to initialize the GPIO that allows us to control the pump
through the samr21 board.

The function calls some GPIO functions needed to initialize the GPIO and sets
it low because we assume that when we start the system, the plants do not need
water.

Function: make\_pump\_close()

This function closes the pump, when the algorithm calls this function had
already checked that the plants have enough water and the pump is still on or
the opening time has been exceeded.

To close the pump the function sets the GPIO to low using the GPIO function
gpio\_clear.

Function: make\_pump\_open(int aux)

This function opens the pump, when the algorithm calls this functions had
already checked that the plants need water and the pump is closed. The pump is
opened for a concrete amount of time defined by the variable aux and then calls
the function make\_pump\_close() to close the pump.

To open the pump the function sets the GPIO to high using the GPIO function
gpio\_set.

Function: water\_level\_sensor\_control (int data)

This function is used to avoid the malfunctioning of the pump caused by the
lack of water. If the data sent by the water sensor indicates that the water
level is under a concrete threshold the function calls the function
make\_pump\_close.

Function: add\_data\_table(int id, int data)

This function add to the table the data received from the sensors. First of all the function checks if there is existing data of this sensor already in the table, if they exist the function updates the value, if not it add a new line to the table with the new data and the actual time; finally the function calls print\_table to show the new state of the table.

Function: add\_pid\_controller(int data)

This function is used to adjust the time that the pump is open, to determine
that time a set of algorithms are used that take into account the rest of the
values received from the other sensors and depending on the distance between
them and with the thresholds, the opening time of the pump is defined.

Function add\_set\_data(int id,int data)

This function decides if the pump should open or not, in order to do that it
compares the values sent from the sensors with a set of thresholds and
decides to call make\_pump\_open, make\_pump\_close or wait for more values of
more sensors, it also calls the function that controls the water level sensor
if it is necessary.

Function: shell\_pump\_set\_data( int argc, char * argv[])

This function is used to control the correct functioning of the pump controller
algorithm and allows the developers to call the functions without sending real
data from the sensors but sending it from a console.

	  gateway.}

  \end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Gateway}

The watering system prototype functions autonomously without the intrude of
human or any 3rd Party service, but it is a good feature to monitor the system,
because with processing the data an error can be predicted and fatal
consequences can be avoided with taking the right measures. Among other control
functions in the system also monitoring requires remote communications.
Connecting with the sensors through Internet can be achieved using a gateway
that forwards and transfer all packets from the sensors to some ip address
outside the internal network of the sensors. Serving as a gateway the node
needs not to be placed outdoor nor besides the sensors, so it doesn't have to
operate on battery, this means that using a high-end programmer as the gateway
for our use-case is possible, because unlike the sensors, we need only one host
for the gateway in the real scenario. For this reason the Raspberry Pi would
perform a good job in our project, it has a powerful 32-bit arm processor with
RISC architecture, it will communicate with others sensors through the 6LoWPAN
interface, well written documentations of using 6LoWPAN module with Raspberry Pi
are being provided by the RIOT community, the only downside in using any arm
programmer like the pi is that RIOT can't be used for it, because kernel in
RIOT was not ported for the ARM processors. This would break the rule of
unifying the system on all nodes of the IoT project, which would be helpful for
avoiding redundant costs in the future.
\\Following the instructions included in RIOT git \cite{riot_lowpan} enables having
a functioning 6LoWPAN transceiver on the Raspberry pi without any problems. We
began programming the pi from scratch using an erased SD card.
\\
In briefly our setup has included the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Setup Raspian OS on the SD card, this is a UNIX-like operating system made for the Raspberry pi.
	\item SSH (Secured Shell Host  openBSD) is a program for the communications between computers on different networks using the shell layer, it is installed by default in Raspian but using it requires enabling flags in the configurations of OS.
	\item Setup the 6LoWPAN module and connect it to the raspberry pi, it worked without the need to reconfigure the kernel of Raspian.
	\item Setup IPv6 for the 6LoWPAN interface and make sure the communications are working with pinging the rest of network.
\end{enumerate}

 After debugging and making sure that the communications on the physical layer
 are working properly and that the rest of network is communicating with the pi
 per 6LoWPAN, we setup a static IPv6 for the interfaces, whenever Raspian boots
 it uses that address.

 There are additional configurations should be done to the network layer in
 order to encapsulate the IPv6 packets and forwards them to an IP address
 outside the watering system's network. Ip route provides management tools for
 manipulating any of the routing tables, it can be used to forward the packets
 directly with working only on the network layer, it is mentioned in the
 documentations of RIOT for setting up the 6LoWPAN and raspberry pi, but the
 inter-polarity challenge for connecting the sensors with the internet cannot
 be overcame in our implementation without processing the packets on the
 application layer before forwarding them, therefore we have written a python
 program running in an endless loop to capture all the incoming packets to the
 raspberry pi, interpret and convert them to the required protocol (HTTP), and
 finally forwards the packets to a predefined (Webserver) address. The only
 function for the gateway at this time is monitoring the incoming humidity and
 temperature data and finally presenting them on a web server, the running
 python program performs this one specific translation of protocol.

\subsection{Data presentation}

The sensors send periodically new data about humidity and temperature, the
values need to be saved in a central database and presented to the user in
proper way for reading.
One way for reading the data from the sensors remotely is to have a running
service providing access to the readers and the writers which are in our case
the user (web browser) and the watering system (Sensor). An available option is
using a web server running with a static ip address, and an apache service to
handle the incoming requests/responses of the clients. For testing the project
we configured a private apache2 web server using ssh communication (as with
raspberry pi). We decided to use python add-on called django to handle the HTTP
requests, the apache module named mod\_wsgi embeds Python applications within
the server and allow them to communicate through the Python WSGI interface.
Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python.
A web framework is a set of components that helps you manage a website faster
and easier. Django provides easy mechanisms to handle html templates. Moreover
processing and reading predefined html files using django is easier in compare
to the traditional web languages e.g "PHP", because as a webframework django
provides the complete structure for building a website.

We implemented an HTTP API for reading and writing the humidity and temperature
values of the sensors.

Functions in our HTTP API include get and set sensor data.\\

Write data to database:
\\ http://IP.ADDRESS:PORT:/set\_sensor\_data . \\

Read data from database (Json):
\\ http://IP.ADDRESS:PORT:/get\_sensor\_data .

Finally the data of the sensors is presented in an HTML table designed with
boostrap css, the table rows include data presenting in sqllite database, we
used django template language for loading html page dynamically.

In our web server we didn't have to reach the complete RESTful implementation
because our interface consist only of two functions, however both of the
functions for setting and getting the data use HTTP get request

\section{Conclusion}

In all cases accomplishing an IoT project for a specific purpose requires
certain rules to follow and a set of communication protocols to implement, so
that in the end to we can get a working network of devices working together
autonomously on one assignment. Most of the components and protocols we used in
our project which aren't specific to watering plants case can be directly used
in other different projects, and in the future they will help making our final
products reaching the IoT standards. Water is a highly conductive liquid, and
in our case it was a challenges to prevent it from ruining the electronics,
this concludes that in IoT a developer might also face environmental problems,
but with using the right instruments to harvest enough energy from the
surrounding to provide power to the system, we could have used the environment
to our side.
